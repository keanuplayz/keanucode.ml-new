My grief and sorrow may last through the night,
And I hope, my peace and joy, comes with the morning.
This emptiness in me, that I have to fight,
Fear and depression, please do not define me...

Oh heavens,
Let me believe that all of my life’s not a lie,
Let me seek the path to freedom from my mind.

Just let me dance, oh let me play,
Oh let me cry out all this pain,
Just let me sing 'till I find who am I inside.

**Who am I?**

**Who am I?**

Sing till I find... who am I inside...

My grief,
May last through the night.
Sorrow,
That I have to fight.

**Who am I?**

**Who am I?**

My hurts and wounds may shackle my path,
But these heaven’s wings might lift me from the grounds.
The memories in me, the lies in the past,
Doubts, hesitations, please don't hold me down.
