Today, I chose to finally go on a journey I've been planning to go on for a while.

I'd like to talk about two songs in the rhythm game [Cytus 2](https://play.google.com/?id=com.rayark.cytus2).

In the game, there's two particular songs remixed by KIVΛ. ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/KivaWu), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/kivawu))

The first, is [Starlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUuB6v2vlYAh) by 3R2. ([Website](https://3r2music.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/3R2), [Bandcamp](https://3r2music.bandcamp.com/))

If you were to look up `Starlight 3R2` on Google, you'd be presented with... KIVΛ's remix.

The second is [Celestial Sounds](https://soundcloud.com/kivawu/3r2-celestial-sounds-remix) by 3R2.

So, if you were to look up `Celestial Sounds 3R2` on Google, you'd once again get KIVA's remix.

Not the original track, _KIVΛ's remix_.

Now, don't get me wrong here. KIVΛ makes _amazing_ music. This track is certainly no exception.

The only issue is, no matter where you search, be it Youtube, Spotify, Bandcamp, or even 3R2's website; you simply can't easily find the original.

I tasked myself with finding the originals to both of these tracks.

## Starlight

3R2 was part of a record label called "Prismatic Music". The label operated from 2011 to 2014.

After browsing their albums on [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), I found the album "[Prismatic Music Vol.1](https://discogs.com/label/308725-Prismatic-Music)".

This album conained none other than "Starlight" by 3R2. No `(KIVΛ Remix)` suffix. Just "Starlight".

So, now I know the album. Then what?

I started searching for a website where I might have a chance at listening to the album.

After about 20 minutes of non-stop browsing the web, I found nearly nothing.

So, I resorted to asking the _Official Cytus Discord server._

Since "Prismatic Music Vol.1" was a Taiwanese release, I didn't have a lot of luck asking the folk in the normal channels.

I was eventually redirected to the Asian channels. After struggling with the language barrier, one of the people there told me they owned a website that had albums by tons of Asian record labels.

It simply served a huge folder with the following file structure:

```
/
|- [Label]
   |- [Album]
      |- [song.ogg]
      |- [song.ogg]
      |- [song.ogg]
```

In there, was indeed a folder called `Prismatic Music`, inside being a folder called `Prismatic Music Vol.1`.

What did I find in there? `06. 3R2 - Starlight.ogg`.

That concluded my first mission. I found the original to Starlight. You can find it [here](http://lolicore.org/Prismatic%20Music/[PMMCD-004]%20Prismatic%20Music%20-%20Prismatic%20Music%20Vol.1/06.%203R2%20%e2%80%94%20Starlight.ogg).

## Celestial Sounds

For this track, I did the exact same as for [Starlight](#starlight); I tried looking for the song on the Prismatic Music label.

Sadly, with no luck this time around.

So, I tried looking up information about the track. Just simple trivia or data.

Doing so, I found a Korean website called [namu.wiki](https://namu.wiki) that has info on Celestial Sounds right [here](https://namu.wiki/w/Celestial%20Sounds).

Using Translate, I figured out that in the first header, it says:

```
This track is on the collection album "再生 Regeneration",
produced by big DTM-composers and illustrators that lived in Taiwan.
```

Luckily, the [link to the album](http://regeneration-tw.weebly.com/) was still functional.

Sadly, the website didn't give me much other than a 15 second preview of the song.

So, I started searching for a place where I could listen to the album.

Eventually, after a _long_, **_long_** while, I found a playlist on BiliBili containing the long-lost [_original version_ of Celestial Sounds](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zW411C7rP?p=8).

And with that, my journey has concluded.

It seems that even though tracks can be good- they can still be buried by a remix.

But, like everything on the internet: if it ever existed, it's still findable. It might not be easy, but it's possible.

Well, you've made it to the end of the post. I hope you enjoyed reading it, and I hope to see you again soon.
