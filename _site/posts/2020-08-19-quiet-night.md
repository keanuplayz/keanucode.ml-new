Tonight is a quiet night. I'm seated behind my desk, idling.
Wondering about what to do.
As I'm writing this, I'm listening to a compilation of dreamy [Super Mario Galaxy music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBFxLv73_eM).

There's so much I could be working on.
I could be working on porting [TravBot](https://github.com/keanuplayz/TravBot)'s commands to [TravBot-v3](https://github.com/keanuplayz/TravBot-v3).
I could be working on [Lexi's Website](https://github.com/lexisother/lexisother.tk).
I could start a new project, although I'd have no idea _what_.

You see, in these times, it's really difficult to come up with things to do.
There's certain projects that I've worked on in the past, which I could be working on right now.
They just feel like such repetetive tasks, that I can't bring myself to actually do them.

Earlier in the holiday, I was actually motivated to work.
I was motivated in the sense of "Wow! I have 6 weeks to do whatever I want!".
In the last two weeks, this mentality has faded completely.
It's very difficult to get myself to work on projects. Even the ones I am passionate about.

Hopefully my mentality to work will return at the end of the week.
By then, we have to go back to school. I'm assuming that'll fix things.
I need some proper human contact.

## Progress

Besides the slacking off that I've been doing, I _have_ been doing some work on a couple of projects.

For example, I've finally started working properly on [TravBot-v3](https://github.com/keanuplayz/TravBot-v3).
Since [WatDuhHekBro](https://github.com/WatDuhHekBro) finished the structure a couple of weeks ago, I've been porting commands from the old TravBot.

I've also made a simple autoreply script for Discord that allows you to, well, automatically reply to incoming messages if you are unavailable.
It's available [here](https://github.com/keanuplayz/Discord-AutoReply), instructions are in the `README`.

That's... about all I have to share.
I hope I'll have more to tell you next time.

Thank you for reading.
