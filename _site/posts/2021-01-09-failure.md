Why do I feel like such a disappointment? Just, all the time...
I've failed so many people... family, friends, you name it.

Not only did I let _them_ down, but also one person I swore to _never, ever_ let down.
And yet, the time that I let them down has come.
I wish it would've never happened, you know? I wish I just had the balls to talk to them.

I'm _100%_ sure if I did it soon enough, I would've been on-time, and things would've been fine.
Now, not only have they lost their _trust_ in me, but they don't want to _talk_ to me either.
I could've helped them... and now it's all over, I simply don't know what to do.

I wish they would just listen to me... I'm _trying_ to help, and honestly, I _really_ don't want to give up, but it's starting to feel like I have no other choice.
Ever since my fuck-up from months ago this has been going on. They won't listen, and they're stuck in a pit of despair.
I've exhausted my options on how to help.
All I want is to have them back in my life...

Things have honestly been tough since then. There's been so much weight on my shoulders, and I still haven't gotten rid of it.
Not that I really have a way to, though. It's just... _there._
Another person has been a major help in assisting me with coping, but I really don't want to depend on that for very long...
Not that I don't _like_ that person, I just don't want to be _dependent_ on someone.

I wish this would all just pass.
Wake up, and think: "Oh, this was all just a bad, _bad_ dream."
The tough reality of it, though, is the fact that it's _not_ a dream, but a **terrible** string of events that I can't get out of.
It's like a loop. Every month since the initial event, so much bad stuff has happened, and I don't know what to do about it.
I just wish I could walk away from it all...
