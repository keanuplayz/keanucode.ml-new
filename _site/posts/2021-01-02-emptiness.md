Sometimes, it truly does hurt.
To know, that when you look up, you realize the true nature of the place you're in and the people you surround yourself with.
As I stare up into the endless abyss, I cry out to something that isn't there.
Why do I long to so many things that lie so far out of my reach?
When thinking about it, a list of such things is tough to make, as I don't even know what these things are.
There's just this burning desire for *something.*
I just can't tell *what.*

As Simon Bolivar once cried out: "How will I ever get out of this labyrinth?!"
Just as Simon, I sometimes also wonder the same thing.
Why do I do the things I do?
Maybe I am just looking for what some people refer to as the "Great Perhaps". My Great Perhaps. My escape from this twisted reality that I got caught up in. Or the reality that my environment is slowly twisting *for me.*
I am just too naive to witness it, or it's progressing so slow that I don't even see the difference.

Every day, more puzzle pieces float to the surface.
More pieces of a truth coming together, my brain connecting the dots.
But with this phenomenon of puzzle pieces coming up from the deep blue sea, other puzzles are destroyed.
Theories, ideas, or mere fantasies getting ripped apart as
I dwell deeper and deeper into this labyrinth I seem to be stuck in, still looking for these things I long to so bad.

Maybe I am destined to fail.
Maybe this is all meant to happen, a series of events tied together by my subconscious, breaking me further and further.
