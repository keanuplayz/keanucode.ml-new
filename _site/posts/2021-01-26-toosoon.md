You went too soon. If you had just alerted us on time, right when things were going downhill, all would've been fine.
You would've had so many years in front of you.
Yet you decided to not spend time waiting. You decided to leave us.
One night of pain was all it took. Just one night.

I can't blame you. Of course not. I could never blame you.
Things had not been going well for the past few weeks. Maybe even months, for all I know.
You were starting to switch gears backwards slowly.
You were easily exhausted, started to have trouble standing up, and perhaps many more issues I'm not aware of.

You just didn't tell us.
You kept quiet.

I know about your hesitance against things like medicine, going to a doctor, or even going to the hospital.
You've been in those hospital walls many times already, be it for that meningitis you had, or that hip you broke.
Yet you fought. You fought so damn hard, and it truly pains me to see how you gave up so fast this time.
It hurts so, so much. You were one of the strongest people I've ever known. Never gave up a fight.

You saw things through to the end. No matter how bleak things might've looked, you were so optimistic about everything.
And now... you're just gone. It went so quick.
One day. You gave us one day. That was all. One damn day.

Looking past it all, though, all I can do is thank you.
Thank you for looking after me for 15 years.
Thank you for all those years of good memories, all those years of allowing me to vent to you, and all those years of listening to my useless banter.
I wouldn't trade those years for anything.

Alas, all good things come to an end.

Thank you.

I'll tend to your garden. I know that's what you'd want me to do.
